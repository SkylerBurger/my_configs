# My Configs

These are my common config files that I often will need when setting up a new Ubuntu environment. Some common project resources may end up here as well.

## Contents
- `.bashrc`: Configuration file for BASH terminal
- `.gitconfig`: Configuration file for `git`

- `.profile`: Configuration file for BASH terminal
